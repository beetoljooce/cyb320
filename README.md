Cyber Threat Intel Uploads for Brandon in the event that a repos is needed for viewing purposes

Hey Brandon (my liege)!

A lot of our assignments have a lot of outsourced code, so I've made this github repository for viewing extrenuous code (such as our YARA rules assignment
which is why I made this in the first place).
Please feel free to browse through this. Nothing in here should be malicious unless stated otherwise.
